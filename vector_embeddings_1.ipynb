We have uploaded the investor presentations on the stock exchange portals, and I hope \\nyou've had a chance to go through our financial results.  After reporting an industry leading \\ngrowth for 6 consecutive quarters, we ourselves are disappointed to report a ne gative top-line \\ngrowth during this quarter. The demand slowdown has been persistent for almost a year now \\nand the festive demand fell way short of expectations. \\n First, let me come to the standalone results. Compared to Q3 of FY '24, our sales in Q3 of FY \\n'25 have registered a negative value growth of 4.0%. As usual, we have maintained the pole \\nposition in terms of gross margins which stood at 47.2%. The gross margins were slightly muted \\ncompared to the corresponding period of the previous year when it was 48.4%, partially due to \\nthe price cuts taken by the industry in Q4 of last year and somewhat due to the change in product \\nmixes which happened. \\nThe EBITDA on an absolute amount decreased from INR60.9 crores in Q3 of FY '24 to INR57.3 \\ncrores in Q3 of this year, registering a negative growth of 5.9%. The EBITDA margin of 17.5% \\nclocked this quarter is very slightly lower than 17.8% registered in the comparable quarter of \\nlast year.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 3 of 16 \\n \\nDuring Q2 and Q3 of last fiscal, we had significantly increased the salesforce strength \\nanticipating higher growth. However, due to the persistent slowdown in the last few quarters, \\nthe incremental employee cost has had some adverse impact on the EBITDA. We expect this \\nimpact to disappear once normal demand pattern returns. \\nThe PAT decreased by 3.3% to INR36.5 crores this quarter compared to INR37.7 crores clocked \\nin the same quarter of the last fiscal. The PAT margin for this quarter moderately improved from \\n10.9% clocked in Q3 of FY '24 to 11.0% in Q3 of FY '25. The base effect of higher depreciation \\ndue to the commissioning of our new plant in Tamil Nadu is already behind us and the \\ndivergence between EBITDA growth and PAT growth should no longer be there from the next \\nquarter onwards. \\nOn standalone basis, for the 9 months of fiscal  '25, we have clocked a top -line growth of 2.4% \\nachieving a sales of INR910 crores. The EBITDA for the last 9 months have reduced marginally \\nby 3.1% to INR145.7 crores and our EBITDA margin for these 9 months was 16.0%, again \\nslightly lower than the 16.9% in the 9 months of the previous fiscal. \\nPAT has decreased to INR87 crores for the 9 months of this fiscal and the PAT margin has \\nclocked at 9.4% compared to 10.6% in the 9 months of the previous fiscal due to the significantly \\nhigher depreciation burden during the last 9 months. \\nNow let me come to the consolidated results. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue was \\nINR342.6 crores registering a negative growth of 3.2% on a Y -on-Y basis, while the EBITDA \\ndeclined by 8.1% and PAT declined by 4.5%. The EBITDA margin on a consoled basis for the \\nquarter was 16.7% and the PAT margin was 10.4%. \\nOur subsidiary Apple Chemie has registered a good top -line growth of 20.6% in Q3 of FY '25 \\ncompared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal, however their margins were  impacted due \\nto slightly adverse product mix. However, the margins have improved sequentially from Q2, and \\nwe expect it to improve by a good measure in Q4 which has always been a seasonally strong \\nquarter for Apple Chemie. We have also made a conscious decision at Apple Chemie to focus \\non selling in those regions where the product mix is favorable. \\nFor the  9 months FY '25 on a consolidated basis, Indigo Paints has achieved a revenue of \\nINR953.1 crore which is a 3.5% growth over the 9 months of the previous fiscal. EBITDA has \\ndeclined by 4.8% to INR146.1 crores compared to INR153.5 crores in the 9 months of the \\npreceding fiscal. The EBITDA margin contracted to 15.3% from 16.7% in the corresponding \\nperiod last year. All other numbers are given in detail in our investor presentation. \\nI shall now give you some more operational details about the third quarter goi ng beyond the \\nsimple financial numbers. During the last quarter, our overall A&P spends as a percentage of \\nrevenue decreased from 9.5% in Q3 of FY '24 to 8.2% in Q3 of FY '25. Now, it should be noted \\nthat in FY '24, during this quarter, the advertising out lay was higher mainly due to the ODI \\nWorld Cup series during which we had advertised quite heavily.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 4 of 16 \\n \\nAs mentioned earlier, we have, during the last 5 or 6 months, been supplementing our TV \\nadvertising spends with significant spends on digital media which ha s started yielding good \\nresults by increasing viewership with our target audience. The overall increase in A&P spends \\nwill be less than the expected top-line growth in revenues. Hence, A&P spends as a percentage \\nof revenue is still expected to decline for the full fiscal. \\nIn line with our disclosure practices of the past, we have given our volume and value growth \\nnumbers for each of the 4 major categories of paint products. For the quarter Q3 FY \\'25, the \\ntoughest market demand situation which Indigo has fac ed so far, the volumes have declined in \\nall the segments except for the emulsion category which is by far the largest category in the \\ndecorative paint industry. \\nOn a volume basis, our emulsion volumes grew by 1.7% this quarter compared to the same \\nquarter of the last fiscal, and the value growth in the emulsion category was even higher at 2.8%. \\nThis demonstrates that our premium emulsions have done better than our economy emulsion \\nsegment, implying an improvement in our product mix. This is a testimony to t he efforts taken \\nby our team to engage with painting contractors across the country who are the main influencers \\nfor premium paints. \\nWe continue to focus on network expansion, on improving the throughput per active dealer and \\nincreasing our tinting machine  population. As of 31st December 2024, our count of active \\ndealers was about 18,600 and our tinting machine population was about 10,800. \\nOn the capex front, work is progressing on both the water -based paint plant and the solvent -\\nbased paint plant both bein g set up at Jodhpur. Due to minor delays in civil construction, the \\nwater-based paint plant is now expected to be commissioned by Q3 of FY \\'26, while the solvent-\\nbased plant is expected to be up and running by Q1 of FY \\'26. \\nThe brownfield expansion at Jodhpur of the putty plant will also be completed by Q1 of FY \\'26. \\nThis minor delay is not expected to cause any adverse impact as we have enough capacity to \\ncater to the existing demand. \\nThe waterproofing and construction chemical products at Indigo paints continue to consistently \\nyield good results, contributing to a healthy mid-single-digit contribution to the revenue pie. \\nComing to the sustainability initiatives. The installation of rooftop solar panels at our Kochi \\nfacility is almost complete and we are in  the process of getting the necessary regulatory \\napprovals. \\nAs mentioned in our last call, we have started a new initiative called \"Indigo Seva Utsav.\" Under \\nthis initiative, Indigo Paints is undertaking painting of government schools in Tier 2 and Tier 3 \\ntowns with the help of the local painter community.

We have already enrolled about 16,000 painter families across 18 states \\nin the country towards this initiative. \\nFinally, all I can say is we really hope that this unprecedented demand slowdown, which is \\nacross consumer products in general and paint sector in particular, we sincerely hope that this \\ncomes to an end soon. \\nSome improvement has been visible in January and we are keeping our fingers crossed to see if \\nit sustains with a favorable harvest subsequent to good monsoons, with a good stimulus provided \\nby the finance minister in the form of tax reductions announced in the budget and the reduction \\nin interest rates announced by RBI only a few days ago, we expect the consumer sentiment to \\nimprove and the good days to return soon to the paint sector. \\nThat is what I have in terms of my opening remarks. I look forward to answering your questions. \\nModerator: Our first question comes from Aniruddha Joshi from ICICI Securities.  \\nAniruddha Joshi: Sir, before the question queue assemble, just 2, 3 questions from my side. Sir, have we seen \\nsome maybe turnaround in the industry in January or still we need some more time to, in a way, \\nsee some confirmation in terms of growth happening in the sector? That is question number one. \\nQuestion number two, how is the, in general, trade inventory?  Means, obviously, earlier -- \\ncompared to earlier levels, has the trade inventory also gone down a bit indicating dealers are \\nkeeping relatively lesser inventory now. \\nAnd that is also,  in a way, causing the primary sales to relatively get a more impact. So that is \\nquestion number two. And the third point is that if we divide the, in a way, multiple segments \\nlike, projects, within projects, government as well as private capex or real estate developers, then \\nthe consumption of premium paints, mid-price paints and at the -- sorry, low-end paints, which \\nis distemper. \\nSo where is the growth rate weakest? Where is the growth rate highest? And the fourth question \\non the latex paints. So, we have seen the market leader introducing latex-based paints to tap the \\nconsumers at the absolute bottom of pyramid and also to upgrade consumers using distempers \\nor very basic level of paints or maybe limestone, etcetera. So, any -- we have seen 1,  2 more \\nplayers also joining the latex paint segment now. \\nSo, sir, what will be the strategy of Indigo Paints at this segment? Yes, yes, these are the \\nquestions. \\nHemant Jalan: Okay, Aniruddha. Starting with your first question about January, all I can say is that January \\nhas been significantly better for us than any of the preceding 3 months of October, November \\nand December in terms of Y -on-Y growth. I cannot say as to how it has been for the other \\nplayers. Whatever market intelligence that we have from a negative growth on a Y -on-Y basis'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 6 of 16 \\n \\nfor several months for most of the players, I think that they have turned positive, but I cannot \\ncomment on their behalf. They will be the better ones to say. \\nSo that's what I said in my introductory remarks, that we do see a turnaround, definitely visible \\nat Indigo Paints, and I think if my market intelligence is right, there is an overall slight \\nimprovement for the industry as a whole, but I cannot speak on behalf of others. So just hoping \\nthat this trend accelerates beca use, please remember, in January, the budget had not been \\nannounced. The RBI monetary policy had not yet been revealed. \\nSo hopefully, better inputs will come in the subsequent months, but between you and me, I doubt \\nif it will be a hockey -shaped recovery. I think it will be a gradual recovery, month -on-month \\nbasis, and we'll be happy if we do high single -digit growth in this quarter. If we are lucky, we \\nmay end up doing small double -digit growth as far as this quarter is concerned, but we have to \\nwait and watch. \\nWhenever demand scenario -- coming to your second question about trade inventories, whenever \\ndemand outlook looks weak, there is a propensity for dealers to keep minimum amount of stock. \\nAs a company, Indigo Paints has never believed in doing unnecessary push sale with the dealers \\nto prop up or window dress our P&L. So, if the demand scenario is weak and the dealers are not \\nwilling to stock up, we let things be as they are. \\nAnd the moment the scenario changes, we find a very quick uptick in demand tha t happens, at \\nleast for our company. So, at the moment, I would say that the trade level inventory, at least as \\nfar as Indigo is concerned, is fairly low. And as the sentiment changes, we would expect the \\ndealers to start stocking up. \\nYour third question, as far as projects and government projects and all are concerned, we are not \\nvery active in that segment, so I can't really comment as to how that sector is working out. But \\nyou were talking about other segments. As I said, the fastest growing segment for us has been \\nthe premium emulsion segment at the retail level. And that has happened because we have \\nfocused for the last 1.5 years with absolute steadfast conviction on the contractors, the painting \\ncontractors in metros, Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 towns, wherever they exist. \\nBecause when it comes to premium emulsion, they are not very price or discount driven. They \\nare more driven by demand generation at the secondary level from painting contractors. And we \\nhave seen that that segment has bucked the trend, and we are getting very good growth in the \\npremium emulsion category. \\nFinally, you talked about latex paints, which some companies have launched. Our market \\nfeedback is that it has not gained much traction, or at least we are not getting much disturbed by \\nthat. So, at this point in time, there is no interest on our part to follow suit and to introduce a \\nsimilar product along those lines. So, I hope I have answered all your questions. \\nAniruddha Joshi: Yes, sir. This is very, very helpful. \\nModerator: The next question comes from the line of Yasser Lakdawala from M3.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 7 of 16 \\n \\nYasser Lakdawala: I had a couple of questions. The first question is, qualitatively could highlight when you talk \\nabout there has been a slowdown in the paint industry. How much of the share of volume has \\nbeen taken by newer sort of competitors and newer entrants into the paint space? And would \\nthat have had a material impact in overall volume growth for us? \\nHemant Jalan: If you do the math, Mr. Lakdawala, the answer is very simple. I think by th eir own admission, \\nthe new entrant that you're talking about may have got anywhere around 2.5% to 3% of the \\nmarket share. Now if you look at the industry leader who used to traditionally grow at 8%, 9%, \\n10% and is now reported a 7.5% negative growth, so that's an overall decline of like 16%, 15% \\nto 17%, out of which maybe you could say 2.5% is contributed by a new entrant. But that's a \\nvery small portion and that is hardly the reason for the industry reporting bad numbers. \\nAs far as Indigo is concerned,  I would say that we have been even impacted to a lesser extent \\nby Birla Opus. I don't think that with our differentiated products and with the kind of distribution \\nnetwork that we have, I don't see -- I mean, I won't say that the effect is 0, but I would say  that \\nthe impact on our sales has probably not even been 2.5%, it would probably be maybe 1% or \\nsomething. So, these things keep happening, new entrants come, some of the old players exit, \\nwhich is not discussed very actively. \\nThere are some old players wh o have dropped very drastically for other reasons in specific \\ngeographies, there could be regional players, etcetera. So, I don't think that any new entrant \\nwould materially change the dynamics of the paint industry because whatever share they may \\nget woul d be a relatively small amount compared to the overall size and the growth of the \\nindustry. \\nNow the problem is that the industry is not growing. The industry is degrowing. Now when an \\nindustry degrows, then everything starts looking bad. But if you do the simple math as to how \\nmuch a new entrant has gained and how much collectively the existing people have lost, I think \\nthe mathematics will show that the presence of the new incumbent is responsible to a very small \\nextent for the decline that is happening for most of the existing players. \\nYasser Lakdawala: Sure. That was very helpful. Secondly, I think if you look at Q1 and I think Q3 in terms of dealer \\ncount, it probably stays the same. Now when an -- based on your operating history overall the \\nalmost 15 odd  years, or 15 years, 20 years, what is your take on whenever an industry \\nexperiences a slowdown, like, how hard is it for a relatively smaller player of our size to, sort \\nof, increase the penetration of painting machines and grow our dealer network? If you  could \\nshare some experiences over the years, it would be very helpful for us to understand the... \\nHemant Jalan: A very valid question. You are right that we -- the dealer count that we show, please note it is \\nthe active dealer count. It is the dealers who are purchasing with a certain amount of frequency. \\nSo, when the market gets bad, although we do add a lot of dealers every month, this is not the \\ntotal count of the dealers that we are dealing with. This is the dealers who are buying frequently. \\nAnd that tends to stagnate when the demand scenario is weak.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 8 of 16 \\n \\nThe moment the demand starts reviving, you will see a very sharp uptick in the count of the \\nactive dealers. You will notice that the tinting machine addition has not slowed down very much. \\nAnd if you go back in time for 2 years, when our active dealer count was about 16,800 and our \\ntinting machine count was slightly less than 8,000, so about 45% of our active dealers had tinting \\nmachines. Now today, when our active dealer count is 18,600 and our tinting ma chine count is \\nnearing 11,000, that number is closer to 60%. \\nSo, what is more important for us is to increase the throughput per dealer. Yes, increasing dealer \\ncount is important and we are adding dealers. The active dealer count, you will see a very drastic \\nincrease once demand scenario comes back to near normal. But what is refreshing to note is that \\nthe tinting machine adoption is happening at a healthy pace. And we don't give free tinting \\nmachines, so these are tinting machines adopted by dealers who se riously want to start selling \\nour emulsions because they have some skin in the game. \\nAnd we just would like to take this ratio of 60% of our active dealers having a tinting machine \\nto maybe 70% in the next 1.5 years, 2 years. That's pretty much what we hope to do. \\nYasser Lakdawala: Lastly, just when you mentioned that I think this year you might see a sort of muted A&P spend, \\nHemant ji, just to sort of get a better understanding, sorry, is it -- what is the thought process in \\nterms of, in such times when there is obviously a slowdown in the industry, is it not -- in terms \\nof if you're looking at long -term brand building, is it not a better strategy to continue a certain \\nlevel of A&P spend because -- I mean that could probably yield better results 3, 4, 5 years down \\nthe line, right, in terms of building the... \\nHemant Jalan: You're absolutely right. And we have never said that we are going to reduce the A&P spends. \\nA&P spends are pretty much flat or they grow by a very marginal amount to take care of inflation \\nfrom 1 year to the next. Normally, because of increase in the top -line, the A&P spends as a \\npercentage of revenue comes down. Now this year, that decline may not be all that large because \\nthe growth in the top-line will be fairly small. \\nSo, yes, I mean, if , let's say for the whole year, hypothetically, the top -line grows by, I don't \\nknow, 5%, 7% or something like that, then the drop in the A&P spends as a percentage of \\nrevenue will be to that extent marginal, but there will be a drop.  I entirely agree with you that \\nA&P spend should never be looked at as a short -term measure to boost your EBITDA. It is a \\nlong-term investment. \\nFor a company of our size, we feel that we have miles to go before we rest. And therefore, a \\nlong-term investment in advertising and pr omotion remains topmost on our mind. And that is \\nwhy in this year, along with television advertising, we have also started digital advertising, which \\nwe were not doing up till now. And a sizable budget is being allocated towards that. And we \\nhave to reach out to the customers in more ways than one to win over their minds and hearts. \\nModerator: The next question comes from Mihir P.

I know other \\npeople have been talking a lot about urban stress. To begin with, the definition of urban and rural \\nis so mewhat arbitrary and depends upon how you wish to define it. Now if you go by \\nGovernment of India census, then rural is considered towns with a population of less than 4,000. \\nI don't think you're talking about that definition. \\nSo, the definition between rural and urban becomes somewhat arbitrary. But having said that, if \\nwe look at metros, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4, in whatever way we define it, we find the demand \\noutlook to be bad across all size of towns. We don't find any noticeable difference between larger \\ncities and smaller towns at this point in time. \\nNow there is a lot of talk that when it comes to the smaller towns, what you may call the Tier 3, \\nTier 4 towns, where a good harvest would influence, have a greater influence on the demand, \\nFMCG companies are talking about some uptick that they are beginning to see in rural demand. \\nSince our presence in the smaller towns is very, very vast and we get a lot of higher percentage \\nof our sale coming from the smaller towns, we hope that we will have a good Q4. \\nBut we just have to wait and watch. At the moment, I don't see too much of a difference between \\nsize of towns and the growth rate. \\nMihir Shah: Understood. No, that is exactly precisely what I was trying to understand. That given that this -\\n- it's been maybe 3 quarters for the industry to see a slowdown in volumes. And one is expecting \\na cyclical recovery. And given you have a higher saliency, the Tier 3, Tier 4, maybe that will \\nlikely pick up the earliest, so... \\nHemant Jalan: I sincerely hope that you are right, Mihir Ji. May your mouth be filled with clarified butter and \\nsugar. \\nMihir Shah: I hope so. So out of the 18,500 dealers do you -- that you have right now, how has been the \\ncompetitive intensity in them? How many dealers can we say are comple tely exclusive for you \\nwith having only your tinting machine inside? Are you seeing seeding of the new players tinting \\nmachine in any of these regions? Any insight in that will be very helpful. \\nHemant Jalan: So, we do have some dealers who deal exclusively with us. I don't have the exact headcount of \\nthat, but that percentage would be low. And it would be low, frankly, for any player in the paint \\nindustry. In general, most dealers across India are multi -brand. Now some may have a \\ndisproportionately high sha re 75%, 80% devoted to 1 brand, but they will have 2 or 3 other \\nbrands which may constitute at least 20%, 25%. \\nIn most cases, in most dealers, without naming any brand, it will be hard to find dealers who \\ncommit more than 60% or 65% to any 1 brand. It will  be generally distributed across at least 2 \\nbrands with about 10% share coming from even local unknown brands. I mean, that is the normal \\ntrend.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 10 of 16 \\n \\nSo that is the case in our case also. I would expect, I mean, if you want a top-of-the-hat number, \\nmaybe out of 18,000, maybe there are somewhere around 750 to 1,000 dealers who are doing \\nalmost exclusively with Indigo. But I'm just giving you a top -of-the-mind number. I don't have \\nany precise numbers to share at that stage. \\nNow the installation of tinting machines by a new competitor has happened across the landscape, \\nbecause as you know, they are providing free tinting machines. So that has happened across the \\ndealer network of any company. The question is, how many of those tinting machines are really \\nbeing used and are being tinted for emulsions, etcetera, I don't have any granular numbers to \\nshare with you. \\nBut as I said earlier, I think we are one of the least impacted is what I can say in terms of the \\nwhatever outreach the new entrant may be making. So, I don't -- none of our sales team has been \\ncalling out as a major disruption coming in our sales in any part of the country from a new \\nentrant, at least at this point in time. \\nMihir Shah: Sir, last question. If you can throw some insights on the cost structure, maybe whether it is \\nemployee ad spends or even the dealer margin, are you starting to see any stress on any of the \\ncost line items or cost structures in any of these line items? \\nHemant Jalan: Again, why don't you just look at data, look at gross margins fo r all the paint companies as \\nreported. You will find that the gross margins of all paint companies, as I have observed the \\nnumbers that have come out so far, I think 1 major paint company is yet to declare its results, \\nwhich is probably coming out tomorrow . But everybody's gross margin compared to the same \\nquarter last year has declined by around 1 percentage point, 100 basis points, and that's about it.  \\nAnd this is more attributable to a price cut that the industry leader took and others had to follow, \\nwhich happened in Q4 of -- Q3 and Q4 of last year. So, the fact that nobody's gross margin has \\nbeen disturbed, and gross margins are intact is the best way to try and judge as to whether the \\ncompetitive intensity due to new entrants has caused any disruption  at all or not. So, for me, if \\nthe gross margins are more or less what they were a year ago, that there is no better proof that \\nyou have that there is no disruption in the cost structure of any paint companies. \\nNow naturally, when top -line growth will not happen, the EBITDA margins will naturally \\ndecline because all your fixed costs will get absorbed on a lower base and fixed costs do increase \\nfrom year to year. So, EBITDA margins may decline, but disruption due to any new entrant will \\nreflect itself instan tly on gross margins. And I don't see that happening for any of the paint \\ncompanies, certainly not for Indigo Paints. \\nMihir Shah: Specifically on ad spends, employee and dealer margins, any comments specifically on these 3 \\nline items? \\nHemant Jalan: See, dealer margin is not something that is offered by any paint company. It is a natural \\nconsequence of your width of distribution. And I've said that many times earlier, the more \\nnumber of dealers you appoint, the more competition you create amongst your  existing dealer\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 11, 'page_label': '12'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 11 of 16 \\n \\nnetwork, because a dealer is competing with another dealer who's 100 yards away selling the \\nsame product, and that tends to drive the price down and therefore reduce the dealer margin. \\nNo paint product of any company is sold at MRP. They a re all sold at a discount to MRP at a \\nnegotiated price. So, there's something called a market operating price. And that is determined \\nby your competitive intensity. So typically, if you do a study amongst dealers, you will find that \\nthe dealer margin that is effectively retained by the dealers would be the lowest for the market \\nleader, because obviously they have the widest distribution reach. \\nNow if somebody tries to imitate that and create almost an equivalent distribution reach, they \\nare likely to face a backlash sooner or later because the dealer margins will get suppressed. \\nNow the market leader is able to get away with it because of the brand pool that it has created \\nover the last 50 years. It is very difficult for any other player to match that kind of a brand pool. \\nAnd therefore, all other players, whether it is the Number 2 player, Number 3 player, or even \\nourselves as the Number 5 player, we have to be conscious that we do not increase the dealer \\nnetwork beyond a certain healthy number, beyond which it starts becoming counterproductive. \\nSo, dealer margin will vary from region to region depending upon how wide your distribution \\nnetwork is in that part of the country. \\nMihir Shah: So lastly, just a bookkeeping one, from next quarter onwards, should one expect the negative \\npricing to anniversarize and we should incrementally see some kind of price growth barring the \\nsmall cut that we've seen in Jan this time? \\nHemant Jalan: I can't answer that question. All price changes are led by the market leader. And t hey are the \\nonly ones who really have control over pricing power. So, if the market leader increases prices \\nor decreases prices, there is no option left for the rest of the industry to follow suit in quick \\nsuccession. I don't think the industry is interested in a price drop at this stage, they would like to \\nsee slight price increases happening. \\nBut I don't think that that decision is in anyone's hands, other than the market leader. So, they \\nare the best ones to answer this question as to whether prices are likely to go up or go down in \\nthe foreseeable future. And if so, for what categories? I really don't know. \\nMihir Shah: Sir, ceteris paribus, the anniversarization should happen, right? \\nHemant Jalan: Pardon? \\nMihir Shah: I mean, ceteris paribus -- there is n o other further changes on -- in pricing, then I think from \\nfourth quarter onwards, we should see some small price growth in the numbers? Would that be... \\nHemant Jalan: Price growth? Value growth you're telling? I didn't understand. You're talking about pr ice \\nincreases. If there are no changes in prices, then a pricing -led growth will not happen. But if \\nquantities start going up, then value growth will automatically go up.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 12, 'page_label': '13'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 12 of 16 \\n \\nModerator: Next question comes from Tejash Shah from Avendus Spark. \\nTejash Shah: Sir, I'm attempting to ask this question because you are at the other end and I'm hoping for a \\nvery insightful and an honest answer. So, for years, we have been taught on the sector that there \\nis a huge per capita income -- per capita consumption gap betwe en how we consume paints \\nversus some of the other markets. \\nSecond, we have also been taught that there's a huge unorganized segment which operates in \\npaint industry. And hence, the organized to unorganized will happen indefinitely, at least for the \\nnear future. \\nNow I can understand macro environment is bad and you reasoned out very well that it has \\nnothing to do with the new competitor. The environment itself is very bad. I was just wondering, \\nin such environment, ideally this unorganized to organized should play out better. And the whole \\nper capita consumption argument should be independent of what is happening on a competitive \\nlandscape. \\nSo why some of those macro drivers, which we were always positive about as an industry, as an \\nanalyst investors, are not playing out as we speak in this current year? \\nHemant Jalan: So, this per capita consumption figures have to be taken on a slightly longer time span. They \\ncannot be judged on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So per capita income of the country continues to \\nrise. When the GDP growth rate slows down, then the per capita income growth rate will also \\nslow down for a few quarters and then they will recover back. So, we have a long way to go in \\nterms of per capita consumption in paints in India compared to the rest of the world. \\nSo, the long-term story, nothing changes. And although it's the first time that I've seen in 25 \\nyears when there has been some kind of a demand slowdown extending for 4 quarters. In the \\npast, whenever there is such a blip has happened, it's gen erally been at most for 1 quarter. We \\nhope that this ends soon because structurally there is nothing wrong with the Indian economy \\nand sooner or later demand has to bounce back. \\nAnd the government will be keen for its own needs and for its tax collections to see that the \\ndemand grows back and bounces back, which is why some of the measures that you see being \\nrolled out in the budget, I mean, it's an unprecedented tax break that was offered. And extreme \\nsituations demand extreme solutions, and which is what the government is attempting. \\nSo, I think in the long -term scenario, the per capita consumption in paints will increase. There \\ncan be temporary blips for 1 quarter, 2 or 3 quarters, but I'm sure it'll come back. Maybe it'll \\ncome back wit h a vengeance. Let's hope so.  As far as the organized -- unorganized sector is \\nconcerned, I won't say it is very large as of now. There is an unorganized sector. I think, a lot of \\nthe clean-up of the unorganized sector -- well, the unorganized sector, what  you call, I think \\nyou're talking about the smaller players. \\nLet's not call them unorganized because previously, 8, 10 years ago, there was a sizable segment \\nof these small players who operated outside the legal framework of taxation. I think most of that\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 13, 'page_label': '14'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 13 of 16 \\n \\ngot cleaned out progressively after the introduction of GST. So, either some of them came into \\nthe legal framework of taxation or many of them closed down. But that was quite some time \\nback. It's been 7.5 years since GST was implemented. \\nSo, I don't see th at there is any meaningful change in the unorganized sector or shall I call it \\nmore appropriately, the smaller scale sector. There are a few thousand of them across India. \\nThey will exist and I don't see much of a share gain or loss happening between the larger players \\nand the smaller players. They have a certain role to fulfil in the paint sector and I think they will \\nalways exist. \\nAnd from our point of view, we have never consciously attempted to snatch away sales from \\nthose smaller players because it's going to be very difficult and damaging to our own P&L if we \\ntry to do that. \\nTejash Shah: Sir, and this per capita consumption number, is it a circular reference number or -- and you -- \\nknowing you, you would have spent a lot of time on arriving at some of this. It has been well \\ncalculated because many times we have seen that some RHP or DRHP will write it and then it \\ncircles back as a new norm. But you believe because when we look at some of the Western \\nmarkets, there is a 75%, 80% is industrial paints. \\nSo perhaps on decorative paints, that number might not be that high as it appears from here. So \\njust wanted to understand the nuanced part of it, sir. \\nHemant Jalan: Even -- you are right that the share of industrial paints in Western countries is significantl y \\nhigher than decorative paints. But even then, the gap between the per capita consumption, \\nhowever you calculate it, for Western countries and India is still very, very large.  Now I don't \\nknow if anybody has done any organized study as to what these numbe rs are and how they are \\ntrending. \\nYou're quite right that when people file DRHP, they look at some published report somewhere \\nand that gets copied, pasted onto that DRHP number and that becomes a reference point for the \\nnext DRHP or the next, shall I say, market study report that comes.  So, I don't pay too much \\nattention to that except to know that in India, the growth story for all consumer products and for \\nthat matter, even for all industrial products, whether you look at per capita steel consumption or \\nper capita copper consumption or aluminium consumption or any particular commodity. \\nWhether in consumer space or industrial space, is a very small fraction of what the developed \\neconomies are. So, we have a very long way to go. So, if you start looking at the paint industry \\nfrom a 10 -year horizon, there is absolutely no doubt in anyone's mind that the CAGR will be \\nclose to 9% or 10% value based in the decorative segment. Now if there is a blip in 1 year, as it \\nhas happened in this last year, it could come back with a vengeance in the next year or the next \\ncouple of years. And you know, -- neutralize itself is what we expect. \\nTejash Shah: Sir, last one, if I may. Sir, we saw a very sharp revival on commercial real estate and residential \\nreal estate around COVID and then it has actually been very, very strong, at least in the metro\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 14, 'page_label': '15'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 14 of 16 \\n \\ncenters. And then we all thought that by now, in 3, 4 years, it will trickle down at some of the \\npaint industry or the tertiary beneficiary of once the possession actually comes throu gh. So, we \\nhave not seen that kind of revival that we thought looking at the last 2, 3 years of real estate \\ncycle. Any gap there, sir? \\nHemant Jalan: Yes. So, 2, 3 things to note. New construction accounts for only 15% of paint consumption in \\nIndia, 85% is repainting. Secondly, when you talk about real estate and commercial real estate, \\nyou are talking about a handful of large builders who operate in 10 to 15 cities of India. So that \\nis not representative of what is happening in Bharat. \\n So if you want to look at construction activities, which, as I said, in itself accounts for only 15% \\nof paint consumption, and you want to look at it on an all India basis, maybe you should have to \\nfocus on cement consumption that has happened, rather than look at the resul ts of 5 or 6 large \\nlisted players in the real estate business. \\n And cement demand has been subdued. So, you can see that from the narrative of all the cement \\ncompanies. So therefore, you can conclude that in general, new construction across India would \\nbe somewhat muted during the last 1 year. But as I said, that does not impact paint consumption \\nto that an extent, because most of it comes from repainting. \\nAnd when market sentiments get bad, repainting your home is something which is postponable \\nby a few months or 6 months. So, people tend to postpone some of these things. And when the \\nsentiments have improved, you want to paint in a hurry and demand comes back with a bang. \\nModerator: The next question comes from Vedant Mehta from QRC Investment Advisors. \\nVedant Mehta: I wanted to understand what the contribution of differentiated products was for this quarter. And \\nif you saw any change and any difference in the demand for differentiated products compared \\nto the rest of your products this quarter? \\nHemant Jalan: No, we give these numbers on an annual basis, because many of these differentiated products \\nhave a distinct seasonality built into it. And therefore, to report on a quarter-on-quarter basis as \\nto what is the contribution of differentiated products is not very meaningful. So, we have never \\nreported the contribution of differentiated products on a quarterly basis. But next quarter, when \\nwe are presenting the results for the whole year. \\nWe will definitely be presenting as we have done for every year in the past as to what our \\ncontribution for differentiated products has been. But on a broad sense, with whatever trend we \\nhave seen in the last 9 months, I don't think that there is much change in the differentiated \\nproducts versus the more vanilla products as far as growth is concerned. I think they're pretty \\nsimilar. \\nVedant Mehta: And any reason for why they're similar and there's no difference between the growth? \\nHemant Jalan: There is no reason for it to be dissimilar, let me say. It's all based on the same consumer demand \\nconcept. So, if the overall demand scenario is weak, sales of the differentiated product s would\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 15, 'page_label': '16'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 15 of 16 \\n \\nalso be weak. So, there is no specific reasons as to why those products would sell much more \\nthan any other product of the paint. \\nModerator: Next question comes from Anand Mundra from Soar Wealth. \\nAnand Mundra: Sir, on Q-on-Q basis also, there is a big swing in gross margin. Any reasons for that, sir? \\nHemant Jalan: Pardon, can you repeat? Your line is not very clear. \\nAnand Mundra: Okay. Sir, on quarter -on-quarter basis also, there is a big swing in gross margin. So, what did \\nyou check? Any reason to that? \\nHemant Jalan: That is always the case. That is always the case. And you'll find in Q4, the gross margins would \\nbe the highest. And that is entirely a function of product mix. So gross margins would always \\nbe the lowest in Q2, which is the monsoon mo nths. So, during the monsoon months, July, \\nAugust, September, the product mix deteriorates drastically in this industry. So exterior painting \\nvirtually comes to a halt. Most of our differentiated products which contribute significantly to \\nour gross margins are also exterior-based and their consumption also goes through a downtrend. \\nOur overall sales, our overall gross margins and our EBITDA margins have always been by far \\nthe highest in Q4. You can plot that for the last 4 years and you will find that trend . So that is \\nentirely to do with the product mix scenario and nothing else. So normally Q1 and Q3, you will \\nfind that both EBITDA margins and gross margins are similar. They are low in Q2, and they are \\nvery high in Q4. \\nAnand Mundra: Understood, sir. And sir, one last question. What is the net cash on the balance sheet, sir? \\nHemant Jalan: Well, we have treasury investments of around INR195 crores or something. So, it is already \\ndisclosed. It has not been uploaded, but it is there in the balance sheet. But yes, I mean, if you \\nwant, I can tell you that at -- about -- our treasury balance is about INR196 crores as on 31st \\nDecember. And this is after all the internal funding that is happening for the capex. For 2 years, \\nwe spent on this about INR280 crores in this plant in Tamil Nadu, which got commissioned \\nabout 15 months ago. \\nAnd now the ongoing expense of almost a similar amount or slightly higher amount is happening \\nat Jodhpur, which is about halfway done. And all that has been funded from internal accruals \\nwithout resorting to a single penny of debt. And we have still managed to maintain our treasury \\ninvestment at about INR195 crores. \\nModerator: The next question comes from the line of Prakash Kapadia from Spark PMS. \\nPrakash Kapadia: My questions have been answered. \\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, as there are no further questions, I now hand the conference over to the \\nmanagement for closing comments.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-13T12:12:38+00:00', 'source': 'f46d978d-3272-454f-9038-c8753e4aac36.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'page': 16, 'page_label': '17'}, page_content='Indigo Paints Limited \\n  February 10, 2025 \\n \\nPage 16 of 16 \\n \\nHemant Jalan: Well, thanks.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us to \\ndiscuss Indigo Paint's performance for the fourth quarter and for the full financial year ending \\n31st March 2025. As Srihari mentioned, our Investor Presentations have been uploaded on the \\nstock exchange portals and hopefully you have had a chance to go through our financial results.  \\nNow we have all navigated a challenging market environment in FY25 which saw sustained \\nsluggishness across the paint industry and may I say so, across the entire consumer sector in \\ngeneral in the country. Despite this, Indigo Paints demonstrated robust pro fitability in the face \\nof extremely tepid growth. You may recall that in Q3 we had reported negative growth on a Y-\\non-Y basis. During Q4 we have returned to positive growth albeit at a very modest 0.3%. \\nHowever, the profit growth was significantly superior.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 3 of 14 \\nFirst let me come to the standalone results: \\nCompared to Q4 of FY24, our sales in Q4 of FY25 have registered a value growth of 0.3%. We \\ncontinue as always to maintain the pole position in terms of the gross margin in the industry, \\nwhich stood at 47.4%. EBITDA on an absolute basis increased from 82.3 crores in Q4 of last \\nyear to 85.9 crores in Q4 of FY25, registering a growth of 4.4%. The EBITDA margin in Q4 of \\n23.4% is the highest that has ever been recorded in any quarter in the history of the company. \\nThe EBITDA margin was higher by almost 1% from t he 22.5% of EBITDA margin that we \\nregistered in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. The PAT increased by 6.3% to 56.9 crores \\nin the quarter compared to 53.5 crores in the same quarter of the previous fiscal , and the PAT \\nmargin for the quarter improved from 14.5% which was clocked in Q4 of FY24 to once again a \\nhistoric high of 15.3% in Q4 of FY25. \\nIf we look at the entire fiscal of FY25 on a standalone basis, we have clocked a top-line growth \\nof 1.8% and achieved sales of 1277.2 crores. EBITDA for full fiscal FY25 slightly reduced by \\n0.5% to 231.6 crores and our EBITDA margin for the full fiscal clocked 18.1%, slightly lower \\nthan 18.5% that we recorded in FY24. The PAT decreased to 143.9 crores for the full fiscal with \\nthe PAT margin at 11.1%, slightly lower than 11.7% that we recorded in the previous fiscal.  \\nComing to consolidated results: \\nFor the quarter our consolidated revenue grew by 0.7% to 387.6 crores, the EBITDA grew by \\n3.3% and the PAT grew by 5.4%. The EBITDA margin for the quarter on a consol basis was \\n22.6% and the PAT margin was 14.6%. Our subsidiary Apple Chemi e has registered a good \\ngrowth of 8.3% in Q4 of FY25. However, their margins have been impacted due to the adverse \\nproduct mix which has been going on in the whole year. It was very severely impacted in the \\nprevious two quarters of Q2 and Q3, but they have started showing a distinct improvement in \\nQ4. Various strategic initiatives are being undertaken by Apple Chemi e team to improve the \\nmargins further in FY26. So, for the full fiscal FY25 on a consolidated basis, Indigo Paints has \\nachieved a revenue of 1 ,341 crores which is a 2.7% growth over FY24. EBITDA has reduced \\nby 1.9% to 233.5 crores in FY25 versus 238.1 crores in FY24 and the EBITDA margin has \\ncontracted to 17.4% on a consol basis from the 18.2% recorded in the previous fiscal. Other \\nnumbers are given in detail in our investor presentation. \\nI will now take you to some more operational details about the quarter going beyond the simple \\nfinancial numbers: \\nDuring this quarter the overall A &P spend as a percentage of revenue decreased from 6.3% in \\nQ4 of FY24 to 5.0% in Q4 of FY25 and if you look at the entire fiscal, the A&P expenses have \\nreduced from 7.4% in FY24 to 6.4% in FY25.  \\nThe focus now in the company is more on digital outreach to our target audience which includes \\nnot only the end users but also the influencers. We have also intensified our BTL marketing'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 4 of 14 \\nactivities, that is ‘Below The Line’ marketing activities to better track and promote secondary \\nsales from the dealer counters. We continue to punch above our weight with a 6.4% allocation \\nof top line going towards A&P activities which is far above the industry spends.  \\nIn line with our disclosure practices, we have given our volume and value growth numbers for \\neach of the four major categories of paint products. If you recall in the previous quarter that was \\nQ3 of FY25, all the paint categories had degrown. However, duri ng the current quarter the \\nquarter just gone by which is Q4 of FY25, the volume growth has picked up in the enamel \\ncategory and in the primer distemper category. Though the volume growth in the emulsion \\ncategory was mildly negative, the value growth was positive at 1.3%, which is a clear indication \\nof the steady premiumization of our product portfolio. If you look on a full-year basis, the value \\nand volume growth have registered positive growth across all categories except for the putty \\ncategory which has witnessed a very small 1.3% value decline. Now you all know that the putty \\ncategory is a very low margin category, and it continues to face intense price competition from \\nour competitors. The revenue contribution from our differentiated portfolio of products was \\nlargely flat at about 28.2% in FY25 compared to 28.4% in FY24.  \\nAs a company we continue to focus on network expansion, on improving the throughput per \\nactive dealer and increasing our tinting machine population . As on 31st March 2025 our count \\nof active dealers was around 18,400 and the tinting machine population was at about 11,000.  \\nOn the CAPEX front: \\nWork is progressing in both the water-based paint plant and the solvent based paint plant both \\nbeing set up at Jodhpur. We have experienced some delay in the civil construction work at the \\nwater-based plant and the water-based plant is now expected to be commissioned sometime in \\nQ3 of FY26, whereas the solvent based plant is expected to be up and running sometime by the \\nend of the current quarter Q1 or at the start of Q2 of FY26. The brownfield expansion of our \\nputty plant at Jodhpur will also be completed at around the same time, that is towards the end of \\nQ1 in another month and a half -time. However, these minor delays are not expected to cause \\nany impact on our sales as we have enough capacity to cater to the forthcoming demand. The \\nwaterproofing and construction chemical products continue to consistently yield good results , \\nresulting in a healthy mid-single digit contribution to the overall revenue pie.  \\nComing to our sustainability initiatives: \\nWe had installed rooftop solar panels at our head office in Pune which has been followed with \\nthe installation of rooftop solar panels at our Cochin factory which is now complete and just \\nawaiting some regulatory approvals. We had mentioned earlier that we ha ve started a new \\ninitiative called the Indigo Seva Utsav. Under this initiative Indigo Paints, along with the painters \\nand the community at large undertakes painting of government schools in Tier II and Tier III \\ntowns and I am happy to inform you that as of now we have already painted more than 150 such \\nschools across the length and breadth of the country.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 5 of 14 \\nOn the CSR front: \\nWe continue to extend educational benefits for the underprivileged girls around Pune. There are \\nalready over 300 beneficiaries of this initiative so far. In FY24 Indigo had introduced a Painter \\nHealth Benefit program starting off with the state of Bihar. In the start of the last fiscal FY25 we \\nextended this program to a few more states and by the end of FY25 we are covering painters \\nacross the length and breadth of India and more than 25,000 painter families are now \\nbeneficiaries of this program. In this current fiscal FY26, we have launched yet another initiative \\ncalled the Indigo Skill Up Program. This is a unique training initiative designed to empower \\npainting professionals with skills that go beyond the brush and help them in their business \\ndevelopment front also. I am also pleased to inform you that our board has recommended a \\ndividend of Rs. 3.50 paisa per share for FY25 which would be disbursed after receiving \\nshareholder approval. Finally, I may add that a gradual improvement in the demand sentiment \\nwas clearly visible in Q4 of FY25 and a further improvement is visible as we speak in Q1 of \\nFY26. We expect the demand to come back to its original growth levels sometime in Q2 of this \\nfiscal. With raw material prices continuing to soften, the EBITDA margins for FY26 are \\nexpected to improve with a general improvement in the demand scenario, lower raw material \\ncosts and an improved product mix. Thank you. \\nThat's all I had to say as an opening remark, and I would be happy to take your questions.  \\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question -and-answer session. The first question \\nis from the line of Abneesh Roy from Nuvama. You may proceed.  \\nAbneesh Roy: Thanks. My first question is on the overall demand side. So, what we are seeing is you did \\nmention that gradual recovery is there and in this Q4 call, almost all the staples companies and \\npaint companies have also said very similar that FY26 demand outlook is looking better. My \\nspecific question is if I see till Q2 of FY26 your growth rate was much faster than industry and \\nin Q3-Q4 when I compare your growth with the official #2 paint company – here I am talking \\nabout official #2 – as per sales, the differe nce is you are going 6 %-7% slower than the Berger \\nPaints. I wanted to understand given your scale and size versus Berger, what could be the specific \\nreason why Berger is going 6%-7% faster because you also have a good presence in the Tier III \\nTier IV market. I understand Kerala is a very large, 25% of your business. Is that the issue when \\nI compare your performance with Berger in terms of why your growth is lower. Q3-Q4? \\nHemant Jalan: So Abneesh, when you look at all companies in the paint sector, other than the market leader, \\nwhich is perhaps as strong in any state in any part of the country, when it comes to any other \\nplayer whether it is Berger or whether it is Nerolac or A kzo, whether it is Indigo, I don't think \\nour strengths are uniform across India. We all have our pockets of dominance, and we have our \\npockets of weakness. That is true for all companies, #2 downwards. Now, when a gradual \\nrecovery in demand starts, and that is Q3 was perhaps the worst quarter for everyone, including \\nfor the #2 player, Q4 has seen a mild uptick for everyone. As the demand scenario starts moving\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 6 of 14 \\nup, it usually does not happen linearly in the same proportion in every part of India. So , \\ndepending upon which part of India the demand recovery happens a little faster and which parts \\nof India the recovery lags behind a little bit, you may find these quarterly differences between \\ncompanies. If you look at the entire fiscal, I think our growth in top line is about the same as the \\n#2 player. It is true we have not outperformed them as we had been doing. But if you ignore the \\n#2 player and look at the industry as a whole, we continue to outperform the industry by a fairly \\nwide margin. We have done that in Q1-Q2, maybe we were slightly on par with the industry in \\nQ3, but again in Q4, if you look at the entire industry growth, we have done significantly better. \\nNow, as I said, Berger has its pockets of strongholds, and I am sure it has its areas of weaknesses \\nand so do we and so does every other paint company with the exception of the market leader. \\nSo, unless that recovery in demand happens uniformly across the  country and I don't think we \\nare very far from that, you will start seeing that breakout of Indigo growth rate versus our larger \\npeers happening as we move forward. So, I don't know if that answers your question.  \\nAbneesh Roy: Partly does, b ut could you tell us which are the states which are bringing it down a bit more? \\nWill it be Kerala and South India where the growth is a bit more challenging?  \\nHemant Jalan: So, Kerala has been under a challenge for quite some time and our market intelligence seems to \\nsuggest that most companies have degrown a lot in Kerala. Maybe we have not degrown. We \\nhave just about managed to hold on to our FY24 numbers in Kerala, (+, - 1%). Since we have a \\nreasonably large exposure to Kerala, it is essential that Kerala comes back into growth trajectory \\nfor our numbers to start looking good . Separately, I would say that Berger is very dominant in \\neastern part of India. It is also a strong area for us, but not as dominantly strong. And I think the \\nrecovery in the market has been a little stronger in eastern India. Now that may have been partly \\nresponsible for Berger's good numbers. And I am not at liberty to discuss as to what a competitor \\nhas done better in the last two quarters to get slightly higher growth numbers. It's a question that \\nyou need to ask your friends at Berger, who can answer that better. But yes, we respect good \\nexecution by the #2 player in the last two quarters. But I think that as the demand starts \\nrecovering, I am very confident that you will see a breakout happening between our growth rate \\nand every other company's growth rate, including perhaps the #2 player, hopefully. So, let's ride \\nit out till then.  \\nAbneesh Roy: Sure. One last follow-up on the demand side. Starting Q4 FY24, you started growing much faster \\nthan the industry for six-seven quarters. That point of time two things you had done in terms of \\ngood expansion on feet on street and then you acquired in terms of the waterproofing business, \\nwhich also would have helped in the overall TAM increasing. My question is now if you want \\nto again grow faster than the industry from Q2 or Q3, is there some proactive step you are already \\ntaking or is it needed  in terms of again augmenting the feet on street or increasing the product \\nsegments in terms of TAM? Is there something needed or it will be more of the industry recovery \\nwhich will help you come back to 2x to 3x of the industry growth rate because that was one \\naspiration you had always shared that you should grow 2x to 3x of the industry numbers?\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 7 of 14 \\nHemant Jalan: Completely agree with you. I don't forget what we have committed and there is no change in \\nthat commitment and that intent and resolve to grow at 2.5X to 3x the industry growth rate. And \\nI am sure forward numbers will bear that out. In terms of what new strategy, I think there would \\nbe a minor increase in number of feet on the street. It is happening partly on the direct sales \\nforce. It is happening much more on the business development officers who are not directly \\nconnected with sales but connect with the contractors and the painters to encourage secondary \\nmovement of paint from the paint counters. That is something that we have found very useful \\ngoing forward, especially in the last 1 year. I mentioned in my speech that although the emulsion \\ncategory showed a marginal decline in volume for the full fiscal. But sorry, it didn't  show a \\ndecline, but the value growth was significantly higher than the volume growth. And for the \\nquarter it did show a decline in volume, but the value growth was higher. Now that simply means \\nthat the premium end of the emulsions is growing much faster than the economy range. And that \\nis something that we have been focused on and that is something that we will continue to be \\nfocused on. In terms of a tweak in strategy, you will also notice from the presentation that we \\nhave uploaded that our active dealer count has slightly declined in the last two quarters. At the \\nend of Q2 that number was 18,700. It's now come down to 18,370. Whereas you should have \\nexpected an upward ramp up. Now, partly this is a reflection of market sentiments. Notice that \\nthese are a measure of active dealer count. And when markets become slow, some of the dealers \\nwho were active earlier tend to become less active. So, at the moment the co mplete thrust has \\nbeen on a renewed expansion of the network and to drastically increase this dealer count \\nsignificantly. And as we speak in the last 2 months, I would say that we have made excellent \\nprogress in that. And when the numbers come out for Q1 of this year, you will see a healthy \\nincrease happening in our active dealer count. Along with that there is also a faster adoption of \\ntinting machines. Although tinting machine adoption did continue through the fiscal. But I think \\na detailed analysis will suggest to you that the pace of adoption of new tinting machines slightly \\nslowed down in the last two quarters again because of subdued demand scenario. That seems to \\nhave picked up again as far as the current fiscal is concerned. So, at the moment the tweak in the \\nstrategy is drastically increase d the count of dealers and along with that the count of tinting \\nmachines, continue to pay much more  focus on secondary sales activities to engage more with \\nthe painters and the contractors and I am sure the results will be evident as we go forward.  \\nAbneesh Roy: Thank you, sir. My second and last question will be on the co mpetitive intensity side and two \\naspects to that. One is if I see the margin guidance which Asian and B erger have given, that \\nmargin guidance is higher than what they have delivered in FY25, which is a good outlook. Now \\nobviously the raw material side is benign, but the raw material side is benign even for the new \\nplayers. So even they can get more aggressive because raw material is soft. Against that #1 and \\n#2, paint companies have given a better margin guidance than FY25. The second aspect to this \\nis the 10% market share claim by the new player. They have said that this includes putty , paint \\nplus putty 10% market share, which makes it slightly difficult to really understand their \\nperformance in core paints. From your aspect, how do you see competitive intensity , you have \\nalways maintained that this is a large industry, etc.? But if you could comment on trade incentive \\nand trade margin, how are things on that side? That is my last question.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 8 of 14 \\nHemant Jalan: I mean, you are talking about the new entrant who was always the market leader in putty. So, to \\nadd putty, which is run in a different company within the group , to that for what worth it is to \\ncalculate market share, I really don't know. To be honest with you , we are less concerned, and \\nwe have never been very concerned about the new entrant and we are consistent in what we say. \\nAnd if you do analysis in numbers and Abneesh, you are a very sharp person in analyzing \\nnumbers. Whatever may be the market share that a new entrant may have got, if that so -called \\ndisruption effect that you all have been talking about or been worried about for the last 4 years, \\nif that had borne out, you would have  the first place where it would have been evident would \\nhave been a significant contraction in the gross margin of all the paint companies. Now I think \\na detailed analysis will show you that has not happened. Everybody's gross margin may have \\ndeclined marginally by half a percent or 1 percentage point. And that has really nothing to do \\nwith the entry of a new entrant who's probably offering 10% or 12% higher discounts than the \\nrest of the industry. I think that has been largely ig nored by the existing players and it is not \\naffecting them materially. Yes, in a weak demand scenario, which is 90% of the reason of \\nsubdued performance by all paint companies, in a weak demand scenario, irrespective of the \\nexistence of a new entrant or no t, there does become a temptation to give slightly higher trade \\nschemes and a little higher discounts to your dealers in the effort to gain some extra sales in the \\ntop line. Now there is no doubt that has been happening during the slowdown period of the la st \\n12 months. And even if we look at our own numbers, our discounts have slightly gone up \\ncompared to where they were a year ago. Which is why you will see that even our gross margins \\nare about 1.5% or so lower than what they were in the corresponding quar ters of the previous \\nyear. There has been some pullback on A&P spends by all companies because in a weak demand \\nscenario it doesn't make sense to keep throwing money at advertising when the underlying \\ndemand is weak. Also, we have made a lot of improvement in our freight expenses and some of \\nthat has happened with the premiumization of our product portfolio. So, despite all that, we \\nmanaged to stick to our EBITDA percentages and maybe EBITDA percentage have dropped by \\nless than half a percent compared to the previous fiscal. Now as we see the demand recovering, \\nI can't say for the others, but we are beginning to moderate our trade discounts, and I think other \\ncompanies are beginning to do that also. So that aided with gradual recovery in the demand and \\ncontinued small but steady softening of the raw material prices will see on a Y -on-Y basis, you \\nwill see a small expansion happening in gross margins and EBITDA margins, at least for us. \\nAnd I would guess that you will see the same for across the industry.  \\nAbneesh Roy: Sure, sir, thanks. That's all from my side. Thank you. \\nHemant Jalan: Thanks.  \\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sona l Minhas from Prescientcap Investment \\nAdvisors. You may proceed.  \\nSonal Minhas: I wanted to ask question with regard to your working capital cycle. Your debtors’ days seem to \\nhave come down, the receivables have come up. So overall the working capital, if you see year\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 9, 'page_label': '10'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 9 of 14 \\nend, the numbers look a little stretched, if you could give some subjective guidance on that, on \\na year-on-year basis, what has happened that will be great?  \\nHemant Jalan: I don't see that our number of days outstanding, if you see always the number of days outstanding \\nto represent it in number of days should not be divided by the sales for the entire fiscal because \\nthe sales during the entire year do not happen uniformly. For us, Q4 is by far the heaviest quarter \\nby a very wide margin. So, the way we look at outstandings is that we divide it by the sales \\nduring the last 40 -45 days of the period. So, on 31st March, we look at whatever sales have \\nhappened from 15th February to 31st March and divide that and then gross it up to the full year \\nto decide how many number of days of outstandings we had. And my figure shows that if we go \\nby that our outstandings at the end of the quarter were 32 days and at the end of the 31 st March \\nof last year it was also 32  days. So, I do not see any increase in outstandings happening, our \\ninventories have marginally gone down. Our finished goods inventory is showing as 56-57 days \\nof finished goods inventory across the company versus 60 days on 31 st March of ‘24. And raw \\nmaterial inventory has also gone down from 36 days to 29 days. And the number of payables, \\ndays of payables to our suppliers has also reduced from 60 days to 55 days. So, I don't think that \\nthere is any significant change in our working capital position at all.  \\nSonal Minhas: Got it, sir. So actually, the trade payables, if I see the year end numbers , come down as per the \\nreported numbers from 220 Cr to 165 Cr which is meaningful. So, I thought I will just ask. \\nHemant Jalan: It is more because during the last one and a half years the government has given guidance that \\npayments to all MSME suppliers have to be mandatorily made within 45 days. It's a guidance \\nand we as a respectable company adhere to that guidance. And we ensure that all our MSME \\nsuppliers are now paid within 45 days. And that has been the main reas on for reducing the \\nnumber of days payable. Because a large portion , most of the mineral products that we buy, a \\nlot of the solvents, etc. that we buy and many of the other additives and containers, etc. do come \\nfrom MSME suppliers. And previously, I mean they are happy to extend longer credit period to \\nus and we used to enjoy 90 days credit from them. But because of this mandate by the \\ngovernment, we have had to reduce that to 45 days, which is why it has resulted in slightly faster \\npayout. But it's not something that bothers us. We don't have any working capital borrowings. \\nOur treasury chest goes on increasing with surplus cash investment and cash generation. So, it's \\nnot a matter of concern at all.  \\nSonal Minhas: Got it, sir. So, if I may ask my second question, if I am allowed to.  \\nHemant Jalan: Please go ahead.  \\nSonal Minhas: Sure. Thank you, sir. I wanted  to understand your position on the institutional sales side, \\nespecially in particular the B2B. Given that the real estate demand has been moving in, some of \\nthese projects would be nearing delivery in the next maybe 12-18-24 months.

That will be great.  \\nHemant Jalan: And developers, we don't have an active project team. We do some amount of sales in smaller \\ntowns, but those are of very small magnitude. But as a corporate strategy, we have stayed away \\nfrom institutional sales thus far and there is no immediate plan to get into that in a big way. \\nHowever, our subsidiary, Apple Chemi e which is in the business of providing construction \\nchemicals and waterproofing exclusively to the B2B space of supplying them to large \\ninfrastructural builders  like L &T and the Shapoorji Pal lonji and a whole lot of other metro \\nprojects and irrigation projects, etc. across India, they are seeing an uptick in their demand and \\nthey have registered very good top line growth during the last 1 year and they are hopeful that \\nwill further accelerate in the coming year because infrastructural spending by the government is \\nramping up quite fast.

Thanks a lot.  \\nHemant Jalan: Thanks. \\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jash Deep from Clock vine Capital. You may \\nproceed.  \\nJash Deep: Hi sir, thanks for taking my question. So, what are your thoughts on getting into a few of the \\nadjacencies in your business, like industrial paints, etc.? So, are there any plans on the table for \\nFY26?  \\nHemant Jalan: See when it we have entered the adjacency of waterproofing and construction chemicals in the \\nretail space during the last 2 years after acquisition of Apple Chemie and onboarding  the \\ntechnology transfer from them. And as I said, that's a very fast-growing category for us at Indigo \\nPaints at the retail level. Indigo brands of waterproofing and construction chemicals are \\naccounting for slightly in excess of 5% of our top line growth, which was zero until 2 years ago \\nand we see very high growth t raction there. When it comes to industrial paints, there are two \\nkinds of industrial paints. One is the very high margin, very high IP protected kind of very high \\ntechnology sector, things that go into tank linings and offshore oil rigs and gas pipelines and \\nstuff like that. Now those would require some kind of a technological tie up with a global giant \\nwho has the necessary certifications and approvals for that. And we don't have that kind of a tie \\nup. We have been open to looking at that space and I have  had conversations with several \\nprospective companies in the past, but nothing concrete has worked out. And there is the other \\npart of the industrial paints which supplies low-end primers and low-end enamels etc. to general \\nindustries. Now that's a very low-margined business and that's not a business that we are very \\ninterested in getting into. And some of our competitors do have a component of their sales that\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 11, 'page_label': '12'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 11 of 14 \\ngo into that segment. It does give them a little bit of a top line, but I think it's a big drag on their \\nbottom line. So, I think we would rather not get into that kind of an adjacency.  \\nJash Deep: What about auto paint? \\nHemant Jalan: Auto paint is a whole different sector. So, auto paints again can be classified into two categories, \\none is the OEM and one is the auto refinish. And both are very different technologies from \\nconventional decorative paints. And getting into the auto sector (A) it is a low margin business \\nbecause the buying power of the buyer is far greater than the power that a seller may have. And \\nyou can see that reflected on companies in the listed space in the paint industry who derive a \\nvery high proportion of their sales from the automotive sector. Their margins etc. are much lower \\nthan what the other companies are. Also to get into the auto space, if you have a tie up with, let \\nus say a Japanese or a Korean paint manufacturing company, unless you have that and that \\ncompany has a global tie up with some of these automak ers who come out of Korea or Japan, \\nit's very difficult to make an inroad into India. And similarly, if you have a tie up with a European \\nor an American paint manufacturer who has a global tie up with some of these American or \\nEuropean automakers unless you have those kinds of tie ups. I haven't seen anybody starting \\nfrom scratch in India and being able to make any headway with any of the auto manufacturers \\nas far as supply of automotive paints are concerned. So, I don't find it a very attractive \\nproposition, both from an entry barrier viewpoint and from a profitability viewpoint. So, when I \\nsay that we are open to getting into adjacencies in the high-end industrial space, auto sector is \\nnot a focus area in even exploring as far as we are concerned.  \\nJash Deep: Got it, sir. Thank you. So that's all from my side.  \\nHemant Jalan: Thanks.  \\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Shubham Shukl a from Voyager Capital. You \\nmay proceed.  \\nShubham Shukla: Hi, good morning, everyone. My question has been answered. Thank you.  \\nHemant Jalan: Okay.  \\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Yash Goenka from Awriga Capital Advisors. \\nYou may proceed.  \\nYash Goenka: Hi, thank you for t aking my question . In this competitive environment your A&P trends  are \\ntrending downwards, so how should we see that? And ex of A&P also the cost has been coming \\ndown. So, is this structural? \\nHemant Jalan: A&P spends on an absolute amount , depends when you say they are coming down, are you \\ntalking about A&P spends coming down at an absolute level or as a percentage of revenue?\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 12, 'page_label': '13'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 12 of 14 \\nYash Goenka: Absolute. \\nHemant Jalan: If you say as a percentage, so I will answer both. As a percentage of revenue, if revenue goes up \\nsignificantly, then A&P spends will come down because they will not grow along with top line \\ngrowth and they don't need to grow. And therefore, if you go back to 6 years ago when our A&P \\nspends as a percentage of top line were 12.5% and now, they are half of that. And that is because \\nour turnover has almost doubled during this period  and therefore if the A &P spends have \\nincreased by let's say 25%, then as a percentage of overall revenue they will come down. Now \\nthe last year has been an aberration that there has been negligible growth in the top line. But the \\nA&P spends have come down but on an absolute amount , this is the only year when there has \\nbeen a mild decline on an absolute amount from 92 crores, it's come down to 82 crores. And that \\nhas been a conscious decision that when the demand is extremely sluggish then to go on spending \\nmoney on advertising and bom barding the media and the end users with that doesn't yield you \\nany significant benefit. And instead, the focus shifted to another form of promotional activity \\nand that is the heavy focus on engaging with painters and contractors to improve secondary sale. \\nNow we have been tracking the A&P spends at least the amount that gets spent on television and \\nmass media. And I think almost all companies on an absolute amount have reduced their \\nadvertising exposure on television and the digital media during the last fiscal for the same \\nreasons that when the demand is low it doesn't make economic sense to keep throwin g money. \\nNow as the demand scenario starts picking up, which we can see signs of that happening, you \\nwill see again an uptick in the total spends that we will do as an A &P, it may still come down \\nslightly as a percentage of top line because hopefully the top line will grow faster than that. But \\nthere is no effort to reduce the emphasis on advertising and promotion in whichever form we do \\nit.  \\nYash Goenka: Okay, and excluding A&P also the cost have been coming down.  \\nHemant Jalan: Isn't that good? Other costs are what I mean the reduction, as I had mentioned in my speech is \\nlargely on account of freight. We have been able to handle freight better. There are two reasons \\nfor it, one is that we commissioned our plant in southern India in Pudukkotai in Tamil Nadu. So \\nlarge parts of India in southern India and even in central India which were previously catered to \\nfrom our Jodhpur factory , now the material started moving from a shorter distance from our \\nTamil Nadu plant. Tha t reduced freight cost slightly. The other thing that has happened is that \\nwith higher growth happening in the premium section of paints at least as far as we are \\nconcerned, see the cost per kg to transport goods are the same whether you transport a low value \\nproduct or a high value product. But the freight cost as a percentage of revenue is drastically \\ndifferent from transporting a high-end premium product to transporting a low-end product. So \\nas the premiumization improves and I sincerely hope it will imp rove further this year as that \\ngrows, that freight cost as a percentage of revenue will come down and that's a good thing.  \\nYash Goenka: Okay, thank you, sir.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 13, 'page_label': '14'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 13 of 14 \\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Aditya Bhartia from Investec. You may \\nproceed.  \\nAditya Bhartia: Hi, good morning, sir. My first question is on material costs. We have seen a very sharp reduction \\nin crude prices but at the same time it seems that crude derivatives haven't  fallen by that much \\nand there's anti-dumping duty also that has gotten imposed on some of them. So just wanted to \\nget your perspective on how sharp has been the reduction in the relevant materials for us? \\nHemant Jalan: For a very long time and not just me, I think I have heard the narrative by other paint majors that \\nthe linkage between raw material prices for paints and crude oil prices is extremely weak. \\nSomehow people are not able to comprehend that and keep talking about crude oil prices. Yet \\ncrude oil price reduction  does impact one or two of our raw materials, but they are not major \\nraw materials at all. The other products are governed by entirely different demand supply \\nconsiderations that have very little to do with crude. Now prices have come down slightly and I \\ndon't think it is because of movement in crude oil prices, it has something to do with the demand \\nsupply situation and various monomers that go into making of the emulsions which are our \\nbiggest raw material. And the second is titanium dioxide which has been pretty much stable \\nduring the last five quarters. There i s no variation in the prices of titanium dioxide. What you \\ntalked about antidumping duty, yes, two weeks ago, there has been antidumping duty imposed \\non import of titanium dioxide from China which is significant. And there is a court case going \\non led by the Indian Paint Association representing all the paint manufacturers. And I think the \\nfinal hearing of that has concluded in the High Court of Calcutta just 3 or 4 days ago and the \\njudgment of that is awaited. Now I cannot second guess as to what the learned judge will give \\nas a judgment and I expect the judgment to come out in the next 3 weeks or so. The judgment \\nhas been reserved. The hearings are over. We are fairly hopeful that the judgment will come in \\nour favor because the rationale for imposing an antidumping duty on titanium dioxide we \\nthought was extremely flawed. Because the domestic production of titanium dioxide can hardly \\ncater to maybe 5 %-7% of the demand of this country and therefore to kind of protect them by \\nimposing anti-dumping duty on imports on which the country is fully dependent on seemed a \\nlittle irrational in our opinion. But for whatever be the reasons there is  temporarily a duty \\nimposed which affects everyone. And until the judgment comes out and hopefully if the \\njudgment will come out in our favor, this is a temporary aberration that we will have to bear for \\nmaybe a month or so for whatever imports that we have on titanium dioxide. But there has been \\nno other levy of any antidumping duty on any other paint raw material. So, I don't think that \\nconcerns us . I n general, we see a continued mild softening of raw material prices that is \\nhappening, mainly on emulsion monomers, a little bit on things that are linked to crude oil like \\nalkyd resins and turpentine and a few other additives etc. I think plastic container prices have \\nbeen more or less steady. Titanium has been more or less steady. So, it's a small reduction in raw \\nmaterial prices but any small reduction is helpful in improving the margins.  \\nAditya Bhartia: Perfect. That's a very helpful answer sir. Just one follow up question on growth trajectory. You \\nmentioned that demand has been improving and, in that context, can you give us some indication\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'moddate': '2025-05-29T11:48:19+05:30', 'source': '27d2a29c-811b-4809-bba2-1dad969f0cde.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 14, 'page_label': '15'}, page_content=\"Indigo Paints \\nMay 26, 2025 \\n \\n Page 14 of 14 \\non how you are seeing the year playing out? Can we go back to double digit kind of revenue \\ngrowth or that looks a bit challenging?  \\nHemant Jalan: No, I don't think it looks challenging at all Aditya. I think that as the demand improves, we will \\nget back to double digit growth. Whether that will happen in Q1 or Q2 is very difficult for us to \\npredict because as I said, month -on-month we are just taking it one month at a time and each \\nmonth is looking marginally better than the preceding month on a Y -on-Y basis. Now frankly \\nspeaking, I was hopeful of very high growth coming in May. Now two things have happened to \\nslightly disrupt that. As you know the monsoons have hit India 10 days earlier than scheduled. \\nNow that has some impact  because the moment monsoon hits as you know painting activities \\ntake a little drop. So normally monsoon hits in first week of June. This time it is held 10 days \\nearlier. That will have some impact as far as May demand is concerned. Also, what has happened \\nin another part of India, which is the northern part of India, which were close to the Pakistan \\nborder. And I am specifically calling out states like Jammu and Ka shmir, Punjab, Haryana and \\nto a lesser extent states like Delhi, Himachal and the northern part of Rajasthan. Now because \\nof that three-day war that we had and those drones attacking those places, although no damage \\nhas happened on the Indian side. But what it does to the sentiment is that all migrant labor which \\nis responsible for painting activities in a very large way, they tend to get sca red and they run \\nback to their native villages. So, their going back is instantaneous, their return back to the work \\ntakes a little longer. And therefore, that part of India has also been adversely affected in the last \\n15 days for want of painting labor. So, I mean these are temporary blips that get made up once \\nthings get back to normal. But I do hope that the growth for Q1 will be significantly better than \\nQ4. And as I mentioned earlier, I do expect that by the time Q2 happens, if things continue to \\nimprove the way they are, we will be back to significantly higher double digit value growth.  \\nAditya Bhartia: Perfect. That's great to hear sir and thank you so much for such insightful answers.  \\nHemant Jalan: Thank you.  \\nModerator: Thank you. In the interest, that was the last question. I now hand the conference to over to the \\nmanagement for the closing comments. Thank you and over to you sir.  \\nHemant Jalan: Thank you. And thank you all for your patient hearing. And I sincerely hope that we come back \\na quarter later with much happier tidings and much better news on growth, not only for ourselves \\nbut hopefully for the entire paint industry  because we are not immune to what happens to the \\nindustry at large. And hopefully the paint industry will bounce back in the quarters to come. And \\nwe will get back to our old story of very high growth rates which the industry has been \\naccustomed to in the last 25 years. And thanks to ICICI Securities team for hosting this call and \\nlook forward to meeting you all again in 3 months’ time. Thank you.  \\nModerator: Thank you.

As usual, we have maintained the pole \\nposition in terms of gross margins which stood at 47.2%.

How much of the share of volume has \\nbeen taken by newer sort of competitors and newer entrants into the paint space? And would \\nthat have had a material impact in overall volume growth for us? \\nHemant Jalan: If you do the math, Mr. Lakdawala, the answer is very simple. I think by th eir own admission, \\nthe new entrant that you're talking about may have got anywhere around 2.5% to 3% of the \\nmarket share. Now if you look at the industry leader who used to traditionally grow at 8%, 9%, \\n10% and is now reported a 7.5% negative growth, so that's an overall decline of like 16%, 15% \\nto 17%, out of which maybe you could say 2.5% is contributed by a new entrant. But that's a \\nvery small portion and that is hardly the reason for the industry reporting bad numbers. \\nAs far as Indigo is concerned,  I would say that we have been even impacted to a lesser extent \\nby Birla Opus. I don't think that with our differentiated products and with the kind of distribution \\nnetwork that we have, I don't see -- I mean, I won't say that the effect is 0, but I would say  that \\nthe impact on our sales has probably not even been 2.5%, it would probably be maybe 1% or \\nsomething.

And hence, the organized to unorganized will happen indefinitely, at least for the \\nnear future. \\nNow I can understand macro environment is bad and you reasoned out very well that it has \\nnothing to do with the new competitor. The environment itself is very bad. I was just wondering, \\nin such environment, ideally this unorganized to organized should play out better.

So, you can see that from the narrative of all the cement \\ncompanies.

So, what we are seeing is you did \\nmention that gradual recovery is there and in this Q4 call, almost all the staples companies and \\npaint companies have also said very similar that FY26 demand outlook is looking better. My \\nspecific question is if I see till Q2 of FY26 your growth rate was much faster than industry and \\nin Q3-Q4 when I compare your growth with the official #2 paint company – here I am talking \\nabout official #2 – as per sales, the differe nce is you are going 6 %-7% slower than the Berger \\nPaints. I wanted to understand given your scale and size versus Berger, what could be the specific \\nreason why Berger is going 6%-7% faster because you also have a good presence in the Tier III \\nTier IV market. I understand Kerala is a very large, 25% of your business. Is that the issue when \\nI compare your performance with Berger in terms of why your growth is lower.

So , \\ndepending upon which part of India the demand recovery happens a little faster and which parts \\nof India the recovery lags behind a little bit, you may find these quarterly differences between \\ncompanies. If you look at the entire fiscal, I think our growth in top line is about the same as the \\n#2 player. It is true we have not outperformed them as we had been doing. But if you ignore the \\n#2 player and look at the industry as a whole, we continue to outperform the industry by a fairly \\nwide margin. We have done that in Q1-Q2, maybe we were slightly on par with the industry in \\nQ3, but again in Q4, if you look at the entire industry growth, we have done significantly better. \\nNow, as I said, Berger has its pockets of strongholds, and I am sure it has its areas of weaknesses \\nand so do we and so does every other paint company with the exception of the market leader. \\nSo, unless that recovery in demand happens uniformly across the  country and I don't think we \\nare very far from that, you will start seeing that breakout of Indigo growth rate versus our larger \\npeers happening as we move forward.

Maybe we have not degrown. We \\nhave just about managed to hold on to our FY24 numbers in Kerala, (+, - 1%). Since we have a \\nreasonably large exposure to Kerala, it is essential that Kerala comes back into growth trajectory \\nfor our numbers to start looking good . Separately, I would say that Berger is very dominant in \\neastern part of India. It is also a strong area for us, but not as dominantly strong. And I think the \\nrecovery in the market has been a little stronger in eastern India. Now that may have been partly \\nresponsible for Berger's good numbers.

Now \\nobviously the raw material side is benign, but the raw material side is benign even for the new \\nplayers. So even they can get more aggressive because raw material is soft.

They have said that this includes putty , paint \\nplus putty 10% market share, which makes it slightly difficult to really understand their \\nperformance in core paints.

And there is a court case going \\non led by the Indian Paint Association representing all the paint manufacturers. And I think the \\nfinal hearing of that has concluded in the High Court of Calcutta just 3 or 4 days ago and the \\njudgment of that is awaited. Now I cannot second guess as to what the learned judge will give \\nas a judgment and I expect the judgment to come out in the next 3 weeks or so. The judgment \\nhas been reserved. The hearings are over. We are fairly hopeful that the judgment will come in \\nour favor because the rationale for imposing an antidumping duty on titanium dioxide we \\nthought was extremely flawed. Because the domestic production of titanium dioxide can hardly \\ncater to maybe 5 %-7% of the demand of this country and therefore to kind of protect them by \\nimposing anti-dumping duty on imports on which the country is fully dependent on seemed a \\nlittle irrational in our opinion.

But there has been \\nno other levy of any antidumping duty on any other paint raw material. So, I don't think that \\nconcerns us . I n general, we see a continued mild softening of raw material prices that is \\nhappening, mainly on emulsion monomers, a little bit on things that are linked to crude oil like \\nalkyd resins and turpentine and a few other additives etc. I think plastic container prices have \\nbeen more or less steady. Titanium has been more or less steady. So, it's a small reduction in raw \\nmaterial prices but any small reduction is helpful in improving the margins.  \\nAditya Bhartia: Perfect.

So, their going back is instantaneous, their return back to the work \\ntakes a little longer.

Traditional approaches using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) use static retrieval. That is, they fetch some set of chunks that are most similar to an input query and use these chunks to generate a response. 
In contrast, our architecture uses a multi-step search that dynamically finds relevant information, adapts to new findings, and analyzes results to formulate high-quality answers.

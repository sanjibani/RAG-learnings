Here are several strategies to improve retrieval :
1. Improve Chunking Strategy
Smaller Chunks: Try reducing the chunk size (e.g., 500 tokens instead of 1000) to make each chunk more focused.
Overlap: Increase chunk overlap (e.g., 250–300 tokens) so important context isn’t lost at chunk boundaries.
Semantic Splitting: Use sentence or paragraph-based splitting instead of fixed-size chunks for more natural context.

2. Use Better Embeddings
Model Choice: Use more powerful embedding models (e.g., text-embedding-3-large from OpenAI, or Cohere/Google embeddings if available).
Fine-tuning: If you have domain-specific data, consider fine-tuning embeddings (if supported by your provider).
                                                                                
3. Advanced Retrieval Techniques
Hybrid Search: Combine vector search with keyword (BM25) search for better recall and precision.
Re-ranking: Use a second-stage re-ranker (e.g., an LLM or cross-encoder) to re-rank the top-k results from the vector search.
Metadata Filtering: Store and filter by metadata (e.g., section titles, page numbers) to narrow down results.

4. Query Improvements
Query Expansion: Automatically expand or paraphrase user queries to improve matching.
Prompt Engineering: If using an LLM for re-ranking, craft prompts that encourage more accurate selection.

5. Vector Store Settings
Distance Metric: Experiment with different similarity metrics (cosine, Euclidean, dot product) in ChromaDB.
Top-k: Adjust the number of results returned (e.g., try top 5 or 10 instead of 3).

6. Post-processing
Contextual Merging: Merge adjacent chunks if they are both highly relevant.
Highlighting: Highlight or score the most relevant sentences within a chunk.
Example: Hybrid Search and Re-ranking
Retrieve top 10 chunks using vector similarity.
Use an LLM to re-rank those chunks based on the query.
Return the top 3 after re-ranking.

Example: Semantic Chunking
Instead of splitting by character count, split by sentences or paragraphs using a library like nltk or spaCy.

Example: Metadata Filtering
Store the section or chapter as metadata, and allow users to filter or boost results from specific sections.

Here are the key strategies to improve RAG retrieval accuracy for your local system:

## Document Processing & Chunking

**Smart Chunking Strategies:**
- Use semantic chunking instead of fixed-size splits - break documents at natural boundaries like paragraphs, sections, or sentence clusters
- Implement overlapping chunks (10-20% overlap) to preserve context across boundaries
- Consider hierarchical chunking where you maintain both detailed chunks and higher-level summaries
- Use document-aware chunking that respects markdown headers, code blocks, and other structural elements

**Content Enhancement:**
- Generate synthetic questions for each chunk during indexing
- Create chunk summaries that capture the main concepts
- Extract and index key entities, dates, and metadata separately
- Clean and normalize text (remove excessive whitespace, fix encoding issues)

## Embedding & Indexing Improvements

**Better Embeddings:**
- Use domain-specific embedding models when available (e.g., legal, medical, code-specific models)
- Fine-tune embeddings on your specific corpus if you have enough data
- Consider using multiple embedding models and ensemble their results
- Experiment with different embedding dimensions and models (e.g., OpenAI, Sentence-BERT, E5, BGE)

**Advanced Indexing:**
- Implement hybrid search combining dense (semantic) and sparse (keyword) retrieval
- Use re-ranking models to refine initial retrieval results
- Create multiple indices for different content types (text, code, tables)
- Build knowledge graphs to capture entity relationships

## Query Processing

**Query Enhancement:**
- Implement query expansion using synonyms, related terms, or LLM-generated variations
- Use query rewriting to handle ambiguous or poorly formed questions
- Add query classification to route different question types to specialized retrievers
- Generate multiple query variations and retrieve for each

**Context Understanding:**
- Maintain conversation history and use it to disambiguate queries
- Implement coreference resolution to handle pronouns and implicit references
- Use query intent classification to adjust retrieval strategies

## Retrieval Strategy Optimization

**Multi-Stage Retrieval:**
- First stage: fast, broad retrieval (top 50-100 candidates)
- Second stage: re-ranking with more sophisticated models
- Third stage: diversity filtering to avoid redundant results

**Adaptive Retrieval:**
- Adjust the number of retrieved chunks based on query complexity
- Use confidence scores to determine when to retrieve more context
- Implement fallback strategies when initial retrieval confidence is low

## Evaluation & Monitoring

**Systematic Evaluation:**
- Create evaluation datasets with question-answer pairs specific to your domain
- Use metrics like MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), NDCG, and recall@k
- Implement online evaluation to monitor real-world performance
- A/B test different retrieval configurations

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Log failed queries and analyze common failure patterns
- Implement user feedback loops to identify poor retrievals
- Regular re-indexing as your document corpus grows and changes

## Technical Architecture Considerations

**Vector Database Optimization:**
- Choose appropriate vector databases (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.) based on your scale
- Optimize index parameters (HNSW parameters, quantization settings)
- Implement proper indexing strategies for metadata filtering

**Caching & Performance:**
- Cache frequently accessed embeddings and results
- Implement approximate nearest neighbor search for speed
- Use GPU acceleration for embedding generation when possible

The most impactful improvements are usually: better chunking strategies, hybrid search (semantic + keyword), and systematic evaluation with domain-specific test cases. Start with these fundamentals before moving to more advanced techniques like query expansion or multi-stage retrieval.
